### Self-Playing AI 2D - An AI that plays 2D games without human input.
```
Self-Playing AI 2D is an autonomous 2D game-playing AI that learns and 
improves its gameplay using Genetic Algorithms (GA). Unlike rule-based or 
hardcoded bots, Self-Playing AI 2D evolves by observing the game screen, 
making decisions, and refining its strategy over multiple generations.

The AI can play any 2D game that can be controlled using a keyboard and 
mouse, such as Snake, Flappy Bird, or Car Racing, without needing APIs or 
predefined game rules.
